1,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"The Internet is America’s most important platform for economic growth, innovation, 
competition, free expression, and broadband investment and deployment. As a “general purpose 
technology,” the Internet has been, and remains to date, the preeminent 21st century engine for innovation 
and the economic and social benefits that follow. These benefits flow, in large part, from the open, end-
to-end architecture of the Internet, which is characterized by low barriers to entry for developers of new 
content, applications, services, and devices and a consumer-demand-driven marketplace for their 
products. As the Commission explained in its 2010 Open Internet Order, the Internet’s open architecture 
allows innovators and consumers at the edges of the network “to create and determine the success or 
failure of content, applications, services and devices,” without requiring permission from the broadband 
provider to reach end users.1 As an open platform, it fosters diversity and it enables people to build 
communities.","The open architecture of the Internet, the 21st century's engine for innovation, allows innovators and consumers to create content and applications, without requiring permission from broadband providers.","internet, architecture, consumer, barrier, technology, innovator, consumer, diversity, community, economic, innovation, competition, free expression"
2,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"We start with a fundamental question: What is the right public policy to ensure that the 
Internet remains open? This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice), and the comment process that 
follows, will turn on this fundamental question. ",What is the right public policy to ensure that the Internet remains open?,"open, comment, internet"
3,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"Today, there are no legally enforceable rules by which the Commission can stop 
broadband providers from limiting Internet openness. This Notice begins the process of closing that gap, 
by proposing to reinstitute the no-blocking rule adopted in 2010 and creating a new rule that would bar 
commercially unreasonable actions from threatening Internet openness (as well as enhancing the 
transparency rule that is currently in effect). ",This begins the process of reinstituting the no-block rule and creating a new rule to bar actions that threaten Internet openness. ,"no-block rule, notice, commission, broadband, 2010, rule, openness"
4,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"The goal of this proceeding is to find the best approach to protecting and promoting 
Internet openness. Per the blueprint offered by the D.C. Circuit in its decision in Verizon v. FCC, the 
Commission proposes to rely on section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.2 At the same time, 
the Commission will seriously consider the use of Title II of the Communications Act as the basis for 
legal authority. This Notice seeks comment on the benefits of both section 706 and Title II, including the 
benefits of one approach over the other. Under all available sources of legal authority (including also 
Title III for mobile services), the Commission seeks comment on the best ways to define, prevent and 
punish the practices that threaten an open Internet. We emphasize in this Notice that the Commission 
recognizes that both section 706 and Title II are viable solutions and seek comment on their potential use. ","The goal of this proceeding is to find the best approach to protecting and promoting Internet openness, possibly relying on section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.2 and Title II of the Communications Act for legal authority.

5,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"It is important to always remember that the Internet is a collection of networks, not a 
single network. And that means that each broadband provider can either add to the benefits that the 
Internet delivers to Americans—by maintaining Internet openness and by extending the reach of 
broadband networks—or it can threaten those benefits—by restricting its customers from the Internet and 
preventing edge providers from reaching consumers over robust, fast and continuously improving 
networks. This is a real threat, not merely a hypothetical concern. ",Each Internet broadband provider can add to the benefits that the Internet delivers to Americans or it can threaten those benefits.,"network, internet, openness, broadband, threaten, restrict"
6,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"In its 2010 Order, the Commission found that providers of broadband Internet access 
service had three types of incentives to limit Internet openness. First, broadband providers may have 
economic incentives to block or disadvantage a particular edge provider or class of edge providers.3 Second, broadband providers may have incentives to increase revenues by charging edge providers for access or prioritized access to the broadband provider’s end users.4 In particular, excessive 
fees could reduce edge provider entry, suppress innovation, and depress consumer demand.5 Third, if 
providers could profitably charge edge providers they would have an incentive “to degrade or decline to 
increase the quality of service they provide to non-prioritized traffic.”6",Internet providers have three incentives to limit openness,"openness, broadband, 2010 order, fees, suppress, innovation, consumer, charge"
7,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"Those threats are even more important today because Americans and American 
businesses have become even more dependent on the Internet. For example, according to the Pew 
Research Internet Project, as of January 2014, 87 percent of Americans used the Internet, compared to 
14 percent in 1995.7 And it is a critical route of commerce, supporting an e-commerce marketplace that 
now boasts U.S. revenues of $263.3 billion.8","87% of Americans use the Internet, up from 14% in 1995.","americans, threats, pew, commerce, marketplace, revenue"
8,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"Of particular concern are threats to American innovation. In “the end-to-end architecture, 
different economic actors can independently choose their innovation projects.”9 Innovation is the chief 
driver of American economic growth, which means that all Americans lose if the opportunity to innovate 
is curbed. For example, an economic study originally released in February 2012 and updated in July 2013 
reported that the app economy is responsible for roughly 752,000 jobs in the United States, which is an 
increase from zero in 2007 when the iPhone was introduced.10 But equally important are the jobs that 
could be—but might not be—created if edge innovation and investment were to be chilled by doubt that 
the Internet will remain open or, even worse, if openness were defeated. ","Innovation is the chief driver of American economic growth, and innovation is at risk if openness is defeated.","innovation, architecture, economic, lose, jobs, iphone, investment, chill, openness"
9,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"Although the Commission has emphasized for almost a decade the importance of legally
enforceable standards, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has twice 
invalidated the Commission’s attempts, most recently in Verizon v. FCC, decided this January.11 It is in 
the absence of these protections for the open Internet that the Commission must act to ensure that new 
legally enforceable rules are put in place. That is a gap that must be closed as quickly as possible.",The Appeals Court has twice shot down FCC rules; new rules must be adopted quickly.,"commission, appeals court, district of columbia, verison, fcc, open, gap"
10,I,INTRODUCTION,,,,"The remainder of the Notice proceeds as follows. First, we generally propose to retain 
the definitions and scope of the 2010 rules. Second, we tentatively conclude that the Commission should 
enhance the transparency rule that was upheld by the D.C. Circuit so that the public and the Commission 
have the benefit of sunlight on broadband provider actions and to ensure that consumers and edge providers—indeed, the Internet community at large—have the information they need to understand the 
services they are receiving and to monitor practices that could undermine the open Internet. Third, we 
tentatively conclude that the Commission should adopt the text of the no-blocking rule from the Open 
Internet Order with a revised rationale, in order to ensure that all end users and edge providers can enjoy 
the use of robust, fast and dynamic Internet access. Fourth, and where conduct would otherwise be 
permissible under the no-blocking rule, we propose to create a separate screen that requires broadband 
providers to adhere to an enforceable legal standard of commercially reasonable practices, asking how 
harm can best be identified and prohibited and whether certain practices, like paid prioritization, should 
be barred altogether. Fifth, we propose a multi-faceted dispute resolution process to provide effective 
access for end users, edge providers, and broadband network providers alike and the creation of an 
ombudsperson to act as a watchdog to represent the interests of consumers, start-ups, and small 
businesses. Sixth, and finally, we ask how either section 706 or Title II (or other sources of legal 
authority such as Title III for mobile services) could be applied to ensure that the Internet remains open.
","The FCC proposes keeping definitions and scope of rules from 2010, enhancing transparency rules so the public can monitor broadband practices that could undermine the open Internet, adopt the text of a rule that ensures robust dynamic Internet access, and require broadband providers to adhere to commercially reasonable and legally enforceable practices.","notice, 2010 rules, transparency, public commission, sunlight, broadband, consumers, practices, internet, open, commission, no-blocking, rule, order, access, no blocking, paid, dispute, resolution, network, ombudsperson, watchdog, access, consumers, start-ups, business, mobile"
11,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"Today’s Notice rests upon over a decade of consistent action by the Commission to 
protect and promote the Internet as an open platform for innovation, competition, economic growth, and
free expression. At the core of all of these Commission efforts has been a view endorsed by four 
Chairmen and a majority of the Commission’s members in office during that time: That FCC oversight is 
essential to protect the openness that is critical to the Internet’s success. In recognition of this, the 
Commission has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to safeguarding that openness. ","The FCC's view has been consistent for more than a decade, and FCC oversight is essential to protect openness","FCC, commission, internet, open, platform, economic, oversight, openness"
12,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"In 2004, former Chairman Michael Powell first articulated basic guiding principles for 
preserving Internet freedom in an address at Silicon Flatirons. Chairman Powell recognized that 
“consumers’ hunger for an ever-expanding array of high-value content, applications, and devices”12
fueled investment in broadband networks as the “impressive generators of economic growth, innovation, 
and empowerment.” He explained that “ensuring that consumers can obtain and use the content, 
applications and devices they want . . . is critical to unlocking the vast potential of the broadband 
Internet.”","Chairman Powell, in 2004, said consumer hunger for content and apps had fueled investment in broadband networks and they needed to be able to use the content they wanted","chairman, powell, broadband, content, applications, devices, economic, innovation, devices, internet"
13,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"A year later, reinforcing Chairman Powell’s guidance, the Commission unanimously 
approved the Internet Policy Statement setting forth four general Internet policy principles intended “[t]o 
encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the 
Internet.”14 Specifically, subject to “reasonable network management,”15 the principles entitle consumers 
to (1) “access the lawful Internet content of their choice;” (2) “run applications and use services of their 
choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement;” (3) “connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network;” and (4) enjoy “competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers.”
",The FCC in 2005 named four Internet policy principles: consumers are entitled to: access Internet content; run applications; connect devices; enjoy cometition between providers.,"fcc, powell, commission, internet policy statement, broadband, deployment, applications, devices, law enforcement, open, internet, policy"
14,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"The Commission incorporated these open Internet principles in a series of merger 
proceedings. In 2005, the Commission conditioned approval of the SBC/AT&T and Verizon/MCI 
mergers on the merged entities’ compliance with the Internet Policy Statement.17 Although the 
Commission did not adopt any formal open Internet conditions on the Adelphia/Time Warner/Comcast
transactions, the Commission made clear that its Internet Policy Statement “contains principles against 
which the conduct of Comcast [and] Time Warner . . . can be measured.”18 So too, in 2006, the 
Commission accepted the AT&T and BellSouth commitment to “maintain a neutral network and neutral 
routing in [the merged entity’s] wireline broadband Internet access service,” as a formal condition of the 
merger.19 Likewise, in the 2011 Comcast-NBCU merger, the Commission adopted the commitments of 
the merged entity to not “prioritize affiliated Internet content over unaffiliated Internet content . . . [or] 
treat affiliated network traffic differently from unaffiliated network traffic” as well as to comply with the 
Commission’s open Internet rules, regardless of the effect of “any judicial challenge” affecting those 
rules.",The FCC adopted the four principles mentioned above in a series of proceedings,"fcc, commission, internet, vericon, mci, sbc, at&t, 2005, comcast, time warner, bellsouth, comcast, nbcu, traffic, internet, network, rules"
15,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"The Commission likewise incorporated openness principles for mobile services, adopting
an open platform requirement for licensees in the Upper 700 MHz C Block in 2007. Specifically, the 
rules require Upper 700 MHz C-Block licensees to allow customers, device manufacturers, third-party 
application developers, and others to use or develop the devices and applications of their choice for Upper 700 MHz C-Block networks, provided those devices and applications meet all applicable regulatory 
requirements and comply with reasonable conditions related to management of the wireless network (i.e., 
do not cause harm to the network). Further, the Commission prohibited Upper 700 MHz C-Block 
licensees from disabling features or functionality in handsets where such action is not related to 
reasonable network management and protection, or compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
","The FCC adopted openness principles for mobile in 2007, which allowed third-party changes to mobile phones, and blocked companies from disabling many functions in phones",The FCC adopted openness principles for mobile in 2007
16,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"Also in 2007, the Commission unanimously adopted the Broadband Industry Practices 
Notice of Inquiry, explaining that vigilance and a willingness to act were necessary to keep the Internet 
open. The Broadband Industry Practices Notice specifically sought comment on whether the Internet
Policy Statement should be amended or expanded.","In 2007, the FCC adopted the Broadband Industry Practices Notices of Inquiry, saying they were necessary to keep the Internet open","fcc, commission, broadband, broadband industry practices, internet"
17,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"Meanwhile, the Commission applied open Internet principles in the context of particular 
enforcement proceedings. Just before the Commission adopted the Internet Policy Statement, the 
Enforcement Bureau had entered into a consent decree with Madison River Communications, a telephone 
company and provider of digital subscriber line (DSL) service, arising from complaints by Vonage that 
Madison River was blocking ports that were typically used by Vonage customers to make Voice over 
Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone calls. The consent decree required Madison River to stop blocking 
VoIP ports and refrain from otherwise inhibiting customers from using the VoIP applications of their 
choice.",The FCC in past years has used open Internet principles to stop blocking some business practices ,"commission, enforcement, internet, consent, madison river, dsl, digital, vonage, voip, voice over"
18,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"In 2007, several parties filed complaints with the Commission alleging that Comcast was 
interfering with its customers’ use of peer-to-peer applications in violation of the Internet Policy 
Statement.27 Such applications allow users to share large files directly with one another without going 
through a central server, but also can consume significant amounts of bandwidth. In response, Comcast 
asserted that its conduct was a reasonable network management practice necessary to ease congestion.28 
The Commission disagreed and, in a 2008 Order, concluded that the company’s practice “contravene[d]
. . . federal policy” by “significantly imped[ing] consumers’ ability to access the content and use the 
applications of their choice.”29 As the Commission explained, Comcast’s “practice unduly squelch[ed] the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible Internet,” harm that was further compounded by 
Comcast’s failure to disclose its practice to its customers.30 In the Comcast Order, the Commission 
asserted ancillary jurisdiction under Title I of the Communications Act and concluded that it could 
resolve the dispute through adjudication rather than rulemaking.",The FCC ruled in 2007 that Comcast could not interfere with customers transferring large files between each other,"fcc, commission, 2007, peer, internet, comcast, bandwith, network, complaints, 2008"
19,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"Comcast challenged that decision in the D.C. Circuit, arguing (among other things) that 
the Commission lacked authority to prohibit a broadband Internet service provider from engaging in 
discriminatory practices that violate the four principles the Commission announced in 2005.32 On April 6, 
2010, the D.C. Circuit granted Comcast’s petition for review and vacated the Commission’s enforcement 
decision. As to section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the court noted that the agency had 
previously interpreted section 706 as not constituting a grant of authority and held that the Commission 
was bound by that interpretation for purposes of the case.33",The DC Circuit Court overruled the FCC's decision on Comcast in 2010,"dc, circuit court, comcast, commission, broadband, internet, provider, 2010, section 706, telecommunications, 1996, authority"
20,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"While the Comcast case was pending, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking seeking comment on whether the Commission should codify the four principles stated in the 
Internet Policy Statement, plus proposed nondiscrimination and transparency rules, all subject to 
reasonable network management. 34 ","While the Comcast case was pending, the FCC sought comment on codifying the four principles",
21,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"In December 2010, the Commission released the Open Internet Order, adopting three 
basic rules grounded in the Commission’s prior decisions and broadly accepted Internet norms.35 First, 
the Order imposed a transparency rule, requiring both fixed and mobile providers to “publically disclose 
accurate information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms” 
of their broadband Internet access service.36 The rule specified that such disclosures be “sufficient for 
consumers to make informed choices regarding the use of such services and for content, application, 
service, and device providers to develop, market, and maintain Internet offerings.”37 Second, the Order 
adopted anti-blocking requirements. The rule barred fixed providers from blocking “lawful content, 
applications, services, or non-harmful devices subject to reasonable network management.”38 It 
prohibited mobile providers from blocking “consumers from accessing lawful websites,” as well as 
“applications that compete with the provider’s voice or video telephony services,” subject to “reasonable 
network management.”39 Third, the Order adopted an anti-discrimination rule for fixed providers, barring 
them from “unreasonably discriminat[ing] in transmitting lawful network traffic,” subject to “reasonable 
network management.”40 ","The FCC in 2010 released its Open Internet Order, adopting three rules: Internet providers were required to meet transparency rules about business practices, providers were prohibited from blocking content or consumers from web sites, and providers could not discriminate on network traffic.","commission, open internet order, 2010, internet, transparency, broadband, network, commercial, access, service, content, rule, anti-blocking, network, websites, telephone, video, discrimination, lawful"
22,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"Verizon challenged the Open Internet Order in the D.C. Circuit on several grounds.41 It 
argued that the Commission lacked statutory authority to adopt the rules, that the blocking and non-
discrimination rules violated the Communications Act by imposing common carriage regulation on an 
information service, that the Order was arbitrary and capricious, and that the rules violated the First and 
Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. ","Verizon challenged the Open Internet Order, arguing, among other things, that the FCC lacked authority. ","verison, commission, communications act, fifth amendment, constitution, carriage, court"
23,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"On January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit ruled on Verizon’s challenge to the Open Internet 
Order.42 As discussed further below, the court upheld the Commission’s reading that sections 706(a) and 
(b) of the Telecommunications Act grant the Commission affirmative authority to encourage and 
accelerate the deployment of broadband capability to all Americans through, among other things, 
measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market or remove barriers to 
infrastructure investment.43 The court further held that the Commission could utilize that section 706 
authority to regulate broadband Internet access service.44 It concluded that the Commission had 
adequately justified the adoption of open Internet rules by finding that such rules would preserve and 
facilitate the “virtuous circle” of innovation, demand for Internet services, and deployment of broadband 
infrastructure and that, absent such rules, broadband providers would have the incentive and ability to 
inhibit that deployment.45 The court therefore rejected Verizon’s challenge to the transparency rule.46 
However, the court struck down the “anti-blocking” and “anti-discrimination” rules, explaining that the
Commission had chosen an impermissible mechanism by which to implement its legitimate goals. 
Specifically, the court held that the Commission had imposed per se common carriage requirements on 
providers of Internet access services.47 Such treatment was impermissible because the Commission had 
classified fixed broadband Internet access service as an information service, not a telecommunications 
service, and had classified mobile broadband Internet access service as a private mobile service rather 
than a commercial mobile service.48 The court remanded the case to the Commission for further 
proceedings consistent with its opinion.","The DC Circuit Court issued a split decision on Verizon vs the FCC in January 2014, saying the FCC could regulate Internet access and use its transparency rule, but struck down the anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules.","circuit, court, internet, open, verizon, fcc, open internet order, 706, telecommunications act, open, rules, broadband, internet, anti-blocking, antidiscrimination, carriage, access, information, mobile, commercial"
24,II,BACKGROUND,,,,"Today, we respond directly to that remand and propose to adopt enforceable rules of the 
road, consistent with the court’s opinion, to protect and promote the open Internet. As the above history 
demonstrates, our action builds on the foundation begun under Chairman Powell, continued under
Chairmen Martin and Genachowski, and reinforced by a decade of Commission policy. ","The FCC, responding to the court ruling, proposes new rules to promote the open Internet","court, open, internet, powell chairman, martin, genachowski, commission"
25,"III, A, 1",DISCUSSION,The Continuing Need for Open Internet Protections,"An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and Infrastructure Deployment",,"In the Open Internet Order, the Commission reiterated the conclusion underlying its prior 
policies—that the Internet’s openness promotes innovation, investment, competition, free expression and 
other national broadband goals.49 The Commission also found that the Internet’s openness is critical to its 
ability to serve as a platform for speech and civic engagement and can help close the digital divide by
facilitating the development of diverse content, applications, and services.50 Further, the Order found that 
the benefits of Internet openness—increased consumer choice, freedom of expression, and innovation—
applied to end users accessing the Internet using mobile services as well as fixed services.51",The FCC stands by its previous conclusion that the Internet's openness promotes innovation and is critical to its ability to serve as platform for civic engagement and free speech.,"commission, fcc, open internet order, content, applications, consumer, freedome of expression, civic engagement, mobile"
26,"III, A, 1",DISCUSSION,The Continuing Need for Open Internet Protections,"An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and Infrastructure Deployment",,"In the Open Internet Order, the Commission specifically found that the Internet’s 
openness enabled a “virtuous circle of innovation in which new uses of the network—including new 
content, applications, services, and devices—lead to increased end-user demand for broadband, which 
drives network improvements, which in turn lead to further innovative network uses.”52 For example, the 
Commission explained that innovative streaming video applications and independent sources of video 
content have spurred end-user demand, which, in turn, has led to network investments and increased 
broadband deployment.53 By contrast, the Commission reasoned, “[r]estricting edge providers’ ability to 
reach end users, and limiting end users’ ability to choose which edge providers to patronize, would reduce 
the rate of innovation at the edge and, in turn, the likely rate of improvements to network 
infrastructure.”54 As discussed further below, the Commission found that, despite the advantages of the 
virtuous circle, broadband providers have short-term incentives to limit openness, generating harms to 
edge providers and users, among others.55 Thus, the risk of broadband provider practices that may reward 
them in the short term but over the long run erode Internet openness threatens to slow or even break the 
virtuous circle—chilling entry and innovation by edge providers, impeding competition in many sectors, 
dampening consumer demand, and deterring broadband deployment—in ways that may be irreversible or 
very costly to undo. Also, innovation that does not occur due to lack of Internet openness may be hard to 
detect.","In the Open Internet Order, the FCC notes that Internet opennes creates a ""virtuous circle,"" that spurs innovation and investment, but broadband providers have short-term incentives to limit openness, which may erode Internet openness in the long run.","open internet order, internet, network, virtuous circle, broadband, network, commission, video, innovative, applications, providers, openness, chilling"
27,"III, A, 1",DISCUSSION,The Continuing Need for Open Internet Protections,"An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and Infrastructure Deployment",,"The Open Internet Order acknowledged that there were tradeoffs to consider in adopting 
the 2010 rules.56 The Commission concluded, however, that any small costs of imposing the rules were
outweighed by the positive effect on network investment from the preservation of the openness that drives 
the virtuous circle, as well as the increased certainty in continued openness under the rules.57","The Open Internet Order notes tradeoffs in the adoption of the 2010 rules, but said they are outweighed by the positive effect of openness, which creates a virtuous circle.","open internet order, 2010, commission, network, openness, virtuous circle"
28,"III, A, 1",DISCUSSION,The Continuing Need for Open Internet Protections,"An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and Infrastructure Deployment",,"The D.C. Circuit held that “the Commission [had] more than adequately supported and 
explained its conclusion that edge provider innovation leads to the expansion and improvement of 
broadband infrastructure.”58 The court also found “reasonable and grounded in substantial evidence” the 
Commission’s finding that Internet openness fosters the edge provider innovation that drives the virtuous 
circle.59 ","The court ruled the FCC had explained well its conclusion that innovation leads to expansion and improvement of infrastructure, and that Internet openness provides innovation that drives the virtuous circle.","court, commission, edge provider, innovation, infrstructyure, internet, openness, virtuous circle"
29,"III, A, 1",DISCUSSION,The Continuing Need for Open Internet Protections,"An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and Infrastructure Deployment",,"We believe that these findings, made by the Commission in 2010 and upheld by the 
court, remain valid. If anything, the remarkable increases in investment and innovation seen in recent 
years—while the rules were in place—appear to have borne out much of the Commission’s view.60 Both 
within the network and at its edges, investment and innovation have flourished while the open Internet 
rules were in force. ","The FCC believes its findings made in 2006, and upheld by the court, are still valid.","commission, 2010, innovation, investment, rules, network, innovation, open internet"

31,"III, A, 1",DISCUSSION,The Continuing Need for Open Internet Protections,"An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and Infrastructure Deployment",,"Whole new product markets have blossomed in recent years, and the market for services in the United States. In April 2010, Apple released the first version of the iPad, which launched
the tablet market.66 The number of tablet users in the United States has increased from 9.7 million in 
2010 to almost 70 million by the end of 2012, and is projected to grow to more than 160 million 
(approximately 50 percent of the U.S. population) by 2016.67 In 2013, over $1 billion in venture capital 
funding was invested in mobile media startups,68 and overall app use in 2013 posted 115 percent year-

33,"III, A, 1",DISCUSSION,The Continuing Need for Open Internet Protections,"An Open Internet Promotes Innovation, Competition, Free Expression, and Infrastructure Deployment",,"We have also, however, witnessed a growing digital divide that threatens to undo the 
work of the Commission’s open Internet policies. As certain cities get connected with fiber or other technologies capable of providing broadband speeds of 25 Mbps up to 1 Gigabit, rural America and even 
some parts of urban America are falling farther and farther behind. Recent data suggest that a majority of 
Americans living in urban areas (64 percent) have access to at least 25 Mbps/10 Mbps service, while only

plays as a vehicle for communication of all sorts—both for consumers and content providers—how 
should we consider the potential impact on social and personal expression of an Internet whose openness 
was not protected? For example, would there be particular impacts on political speech, on the ability of 
consumers to use the Internet to express themselves, or on the Internet’s role as a “marketplace of ideas”

primary focus was on the market between broadband providers and their end-user subscribers. The record 
contained no evidence of U.S. broadband providers engaging in pay-for-priority arrangements, in which 
the broadband provider would agree with a third party to directly or indirectly prioritize some traffic over 
other traffic to reach the provider’s subscribers.82 As such, the Commission found that such arrangements 
would be a “significant departure from historical and current practice.”83 ","When the Open Internet Order was adopted in 2010, broadband providers did not make businesses pay for priority traffic.

over a decade. Thus, while the number of existing cases has been relatively few, we believe this to be 
primarily due to the fact that the Commission has had policies in place during the period in question that 
it has been ready to enforce.89 This is different from the experience under the European legal framework, 
which for the most part has not contained rules or policies prohibiting blocking and discriminatory 
practices like the Commission’s open Internet regulatory policies.90 In the absence of such rules and 
policies, commenters note more instances of broadband providers engaging in some level of restriction in 
Europe than the Commission has witnessed in the United States under its open Internet policies.91 For 
example, a survey conducted by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications 
(BEREC) shows that European Internet service providers reported engaging in specific restrictions such 
as traffic degradation as well as blocking and throttling when accessing “specific applications (such as 
gaming, streaming, e-mail or instant messaging service) and, to a much lesser extent, when [accessing] 
specific content and application providers.”92 We seek comment on this analysis and ask whether there is 
some other explanation to account for this phenomenon. ","There have been few cases of open Internet violations probably because of previous FCC policies.

occur. For example, in 2012, the Commission reached a $1.25 million settlement with Verizon for 
refusing to allow tethering apps on Verizon smartphones, based on openness requirements attached to Verizon’s Upper 700 MHz C-Block license.93 In the same year, consumers also complained when AT&T 
refused to permit Apple’s FaceTime iPhone and iPad application to use its mobile network, restricting its 
use to times when the end user was connected to Wi-Fi and thus to another broadband provider, although 
the Commission did not conclude whether such a practice violated our open Internet principles.94 We

access service had multiple incentives to limit Internet openness. The Order concluded that the threat of 
broadband provider interference with Internet openness would be exacerbated by—but did not depend 
on—such providers possessing market power over potential subscribers in their choice of broadband 
provider. However, the Commission found that most residential customers have only one or two options 
for wireline broadband Internet access service, increasing the risk of market power, and found the future 
of mobile Internet access service as a competing substitute remained unclear.95 Moreover, the 
Commission emphasized that customers may incur significant costs in switching from one provider to 
another, thus creating “terminating monopolies” for content providers needing high-speed broadband 
service to reach end users.96","Market power exacerbates the likelihood of a broadband provider interfering with Internet openness.

also grounded in “common sense and economic reality.”97 It affirmed the Commission’s conclusions that

broadband providers generally have incentives to accept fees from edge providers.98 And the court cited 
with approval the Commission’s conclusion that a broadband provider would be unlikely to fully account 
for the harms resulting from such practices.99 The court also upheld the agency’s conclusion that such 
incentives could “produce widespread interference with the Internet’s openness in the absence of 
Commission action.”100 Finally, the court agreed that the Commission need not engage in a market power 
analysis to justify its rules, explaining that broadband providers’ ability to block or disadvantage edge

broadband service does not meet their needs. What is the extent of switching costs, and how do switching
costs affect the incentives and economic ability of providers to limit Internet openness?104 As discussed 
in the Open Internet Order and affirmed by the D.C. Circuit, both edge providers seeking access to end 
users and end users seeking access to edge providers are subject to the gatekeeper effect of a retail 
broadband provider.105 Absent multi-homing, an end user has only one option to reach a given edge 
provider’s content.106 To reach any given end user, an edge provider must ensure that it or its broadband
provider can reach the end user’s broadband provider. Terms and conditions, price, or lack of other 
broadband providers, among other factors, can raise switching costs to the point where switching is 
inefficient, infeasible, or even impossible.107 We seek comment on these conclusions. To what extent do consumers face significant switching costs in choosing to change broadband access providers? Which 
services, if any, are most vulnerable to a broadband provider’s market power because of the inability to 
effectively reach subscribers through other means? To the extent that such switching costs exist, to what 
extent, if any, are they exacerbated by additional factors, such as the difficulty consumers may have in 
effectively monitoring the extent to which edge providers have difficulty reaching them, the number of 
effective substitutes a consumer may have among broadband providers, or the impact of bundled pricing 
and switching costs attached to the purchase or use of bundled services, such as a combined offering of 
broadband access along with video services and voice telephony? Would all likely alternatives have 
similar incentives to limit openness, possibly for a different set of services? We also seek comment on an 
end user’s ability to switch broadband providers in response to specific broadband provider practice, for 
example a broadband provider’s decision to charge an edge provider to reach the customer. Are 
switching costs relevant to an edge provider’s interaction with a broadband provider and, if so, how?
Finally, what are the implications when consumers have no ability to switch providers because there is 
only one provider offering service to the consumer’s location?

increases on end users.”111 Nor do we believe that the open Internet concerns described above solely 
arise in markets where broadband providers possess market power over subscriber prices. We recognize, 
however, that the presence or absence of market power—over broadband subscriptions, over end users

broadband providers may offer “specialized services” over the same last-mile connections used to provide 
broadband service. The Commission stated that these services can benefit end users and spur investment, 
but also noted the potential for specialized services to jeopardize the open Internet.135 Due to these 
concerns, the Commission stated that it would monitor these services, but that its rules would “not 
prevent broadband providers from offering specialized services such as facilities-based VoIP.”136 We 
tentatively conclude that we should maintain this approach and continue to closely monitor the 
development of specialized services to ensure that broadband providers are not using them to bypass the 
open Internet rules or otherwise undermine a free and open Internet. We seek comment on this tentative 
conclusion. How can we ensure that the specialized services exception is not used to circumvent our open 
Internet rules? In addition, should specialized services be addressed within the scope of the

broadband Internet access service did not itself address reasonable network management, the concept was 
incorporated into each of the 2010 rules. Specifically, the transparency rule “does not require public 
disclosure of competitively sensitive information or information that would compromise network security 
or undermine the efficacy of reasonable network management practices.”139 The 2010 no-blocking rule
was made expressly subject to “reasonable network management.”140 And the unreasonable 
discrimination rule expressly provided for reasonable network management, which was defined as 
follows: “A network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate and tailored to achieving a 
legitimate network management purpose, taking into account the particular network architecture and 
technology of the broadband Internet access service.”141 The Commission further concluded that it would 
“develop the scope of reasonable network management on a case-by-case basis.”142 We tentatively 
conclude that we should continue the same approach. We seek comment on this conclusion as applied to 
an enhanced transparency rule, our re-adoption of the no-blocking rule, and the proposal to adopt a 
“commercially reasonable” standard. How can we ensure that the ability of providers to engage in 
reasonable network management is not used to circumvent the open Internet protections implemented by 
our proposed rules?","Reasonable Network Management: The FCC did not define ""reasonable network management"" in 2010 and said it would consider the scope on a case-by-case basis.

62,"III, B",DISCUSSION,Scope of the Rules,,,"Mobile Services. The Open Internet Order also adopted definitions for “fixed” and 
“mobile” Internet access service. It defined “fixed broadband Internet access service” to expressly 
include “broadband Internet access service that serves end users primarily at fixed endpoints using 
stationary equipment, . . . fixed wireless services (including fixed unlicensed wireless services), and fixed 
satellite services.”143 It defined “mobile broadband Internet access service” as “a broadband Internet 
access service that serves end users primarily using mobile stations.”144 The impact of this distinction 
varied by rule. The transparency rule applies equally to both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access 
service. The no-blocking rule applied a different standard to mobile broadband Internet access 
services,145 and mobile Internet access service was excluded from the unreasonable discrimination rule.

on this approach, which is discussed in more detail in the context of each of the proposed rules below. 
We recognize that there have been significant changes since 2010 in the mobile marketplace, including 
how mobile providers manage their networks, the increased use of Wi-Fi, and the increased use of mobile 
devices and applications. We seek comment on whether and, if so, how these changes should lead us to 
revisit our treatment of mobile broadband service. Specifically, we seek comment below on whether the no-blocking rule should continue to distinguish between fixed and mobile broadband146 and whether, 
under the commercially reasonable rule, mobile networks should be subject to the same totality-of-the-
circumstances test as fixed broadband.147 In addition, how should the definitions of “fixed” and “mobile” 
services be applied to a fixed broadband provider’s commercially deployed Wi-Fi service that is made 
available to the provider’s fixed broadband customers? How should such changes affect our treatment of 
reasonable network management for mobile providers? Similarly, how should we treat mobile services 
that are deployed and/or marketed as express substitutes for traditional telecommunications or broadband 
services? Finally, have there been changes in technology or the marketplace for the provision of satellite

to accurate information about broadband provider practices encourages the competition, innovation, and 
high-quality services that drive consumer demand and broadband investment and deployment.157 The 
transparency rule thereby reflects the “virtuous circle” that, in the long term, unites the interests of end users, edge providers, and the broader Internet community. As the Commission explained in the Open

whether there are network practices, performance characteristics, or commercial terms relating to 
broadband service that are particularly essential but not easily discoverable by end users absent effective

would not impermissibly subject broadband providers to common carriage regulation.200 To address the 
ongoing concerns with the harmful effects that blocking of Internet traffic would have on Internet 
openness, we propose to adopt the text of the no-blocking rule that the Commission adopted in 2010, with 
a clarification that it does not preclude broadband providers from negotiating individualized, 
differentiated arrangements with similarly situated edge providers (subject to the separate commercial
reasonableness rule or its equivalent). So long as broadband providers do not degrade lawful content or 
service to below a minimum level of access, they would not run afoul of the proposed rule. We also seek 
comment below on how to define that minimum level of service. Alternatively, we seek comment on

In response, the FCC seeks to keep the same text of the no-blocking rule from 2010, but with an extra detail that it doesn't preclude broadband providers from negotiating individualized arrangements with edge providers-- as long as the broadband providers don't degrade lawful content or limit service outside of the proposed rule.

access service. Our proposed approach is both more focused and more flexible than the vacated 2010 
non-discrimination rule. It would prohibit as commercially unreasonable those broadband providers’ 
practices that, based on the totality of the circumstances, threaten to harm Internet openness and all that it 
protects. At the same time, it could permit broadband providers to serve customers and carry traffic on an 
individually negotiated basis, “without having to hold themselves out to serve all comers indiscriminately 
on the same or standardized terms,” so long as such conduct is commercially reasonable.246 The D.C. 
Circuit explained that such an approach distinguished the data roaming rules at issue in Cellco from 
common carrier obligations.247 We seek general comment on this approach, and more targeted comment 
below. ","The FCC tentatively concludes it should adopt a rule requiring broadband providers to use ""commercially reasonable"" practices when it comes to access.",

separately from the no-blocking rule that we also propose to adopt. In other words, the presence or 
absence of the no-blocking rule would have no impact on the presence or absence of the “commercially 
reasonable” standard, and vice versa. This would mean that conduct acceptable under the no-blocking

reasonable” standard or another legal formulation, is to effectively employ the authority that the Verizon 
court held was within the Commission’s power under section 706. In essence, the court upheld the 
Commission’s judgment that (1) section 706 grants substantive power to the Commission to take actions, 
including removing barriers to infrastructure investment and promoting competition in telecommunications markets, that will promote the deployment of broadband networks; (2) the 
Commission was within its authority to conclude that the “virtuous circle” can be adversely impacted by 
broadband network practices that, over the long term, depress end user demand, which then threatens
broadband deployment; and (3) threats to the open Internet, such as limitations on users to access the 
content of their choice or speak their views freely, are therefore within the authority of the Commission to 
curb. In selecting a legal standard, the Commission not only wishes to avoid subjecting broadband 
networks to common carriage per se, it also wishes to choose a legal standard whose valid adoption 
renders unnecessary the adjudication of any question other than whether the adopted legal standard has 
been violated. This is the distinction between the authority to adopt a standard and its subsequent 
application.248","The ""commercially reasonable"" standard is legally strong, based on previous court rulings.",

politically oriented website with an audience of fewer than 100 unique visitors per day, a social 
networking application narrowly focused on a particular demographic, or peer-to-peer communications 
among individuals. Not all of those actors may seek to enter into a contract with a broadband provider;

noted, that holding “was limited to remedying a specific perceived evil [that] did not amount to a duty to 
hold out facilities indifferently for public use.”269 In Verizon, the D.C. Circuit likewise explained that the 
Southwestern Cable regulation “imposed no obligation on cable operators to hold their facilities open to 
the public generally, but only to certain broadcasters if and when cable operators acted in ways that might

services that meet the definition of “commercial mobile service”303 be regulated as common carriers under Title II.304 In response, the Commission received substantial comments on these issues. We now 
seek further and updated comment on whether the Commission should revisit its prior classification 
decisions and apply Title II to broadband Internet access service (or components thereof). How would 
such a reclassification approach serve our goal to protect and promote Internet openness? What would be 
the legal bases and theories for particular open Internet rules adopted pursuant to such an approach?

openness impact the Commission’s overall policy goals and, if so, how? ",The FCC has modified the classification of broadband Internet access services before.Would a reclassification help? ,

integrated with applications and other offerings, such that they are “inextricably intertwined” with the 
underlying connectivity service?305 Is broadband Internet access service (or any telecommunications 
component thereof) held out “for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be 
effectively available directly to the public?”306 If not, should the Commission compel the offering of such 
functionality on a common carrier basis even if not offered as such? For mobile broadband Internet 
access service, does that service fit within the definition of “commercial mobile service”?307 We also note 
that on May 14, 2014, Representative Henry Waxman, Ranking Member of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, sent a letter to Chairman Wheeler proposing an 
approach to protecting the open Internet whereby the Commission would proceed under section 706 but 
use Title II as a “backstop authority.”308 We seek comment on the viability of that approach.",What should the FCC consider before revisiting prior decisions? ,
151,"III, F, 2",DISCUSSION,Legal Authority,Title II,,"Title II—Classification of the Broadband Providers’ Service to Edge Providers. Separate 
from the reclassification of “broadband Internet access service,” we seek comment on how the 
Commission should consider broadband providers’ service to edge providers and whether that service (or 
some portion of it) is subject to Title II regulation. As mentioned above, in Verizon, the D.C. Circuit 
stated that “broadband providers furnish a service to edge providers, thus undoubtedly functioning as edge providers’ ‘carriers.’”309 We understand such service to include the flow of Internet traffic on the 
broadband providers’ own network, and not how it gets to the broadband providers’ networks. The 
Commission in the Open Internet Order understood the 2010 rules to regulate “broadband Internet access 
service,” which the Commission classified as an information service. That service, however, is by 
definition a “mass-market retail service” providing the capability to send and receive data from “all 
Internet end points.”310 Does the “service” contemplated by the court between broadband providers and 
edge providers fit that definition? We seek comment on whether and, if so how, the Commission should 
separately identify and classify a broadband service that is furnished by broadband providers’ to edge 
providers in order to protect and promote Internet openness. ",Are broadband provider's service to edge providers subject to Title II regulation? ,
152,"III, F, 2",DISCUSSION,Legal Authority,Title II,,"Some have made proposals suggesting that the Commission could apply Title II to such 
services to achieve our open Internet objectives. For example, on May 5, 2014, Mozilla filed a petition 
requesting that the Commission (1) recognize remote delivery services in terminating access networks; 
(2) classify these services as “telecommunications services” under Title II of the Act; and (3) forbear from 
any “inapplicable or undesirable provisions of Title II” for such services.311 Mozilla states that, unlike the 
end-user facing broadband services the Commission has classified as information services, the
Commission has not classified the service that broadband Internet providers to remote endpoints, 
particularly to entities not in privity with the broadband provider.312 These services, Mozilla argues, can 
and should be classified as telecommunications services, subject to whatever Title II regulations the 
Commission deems appropriate.313 Similarly, academics from Columbia University have submitted an 
alternate proposal to classify Internet-facing services that a broadband provider offers.314 This theory 
would split broadband Internet access service into two components: first, the subscriber’s “request [for] 
data from a third-party provider; and second, the content provider’s response to the subscriber.”315 The 
proposal would classify the latter “sender-side” traffic, sent in response to a broadband provider’s 
customer’s request as a telecommunications service, subject to Title II.316 According to the proposal, this 
is a stand-alone offer of telecommunications—transmission between points specified by the end-user.317 
We seek comment on these proposals and other suggestions for how the Commission could identify and 
classify such services and apply Title II to achieve our goals of protecting and promoting Internet 
openness.","How can the FCC apply Title II to ""telecommunications services?"" ",
153,"III, F, 2",DISCUSSION,Legal Authority,Title II,,"Title II—Forbearance. If the Commission were to reclassify broadband Internet access 
service as described above or classify a separate broadband service provided to edge providers as a 
“telecommunications service,” such a service would then be subject to all of the requirements of the Act 
and Commission rules that would flow from the classification of a service as a telecommunications 
service or common carrier service. Should the Commission take such an approach, we seek comment on 
the extent to which forbearance from certain provisions of the Act or our rules would be justified in order 
to strike the right balance between minimizing the regulatory burden on providers and ensuring that the 
public interest is served.318 For mobile broadband services, we seek comment on whether and how the 
Commission should apply section 332(c)(1) in addition to section 10 forbearance.319","If the FCC reclasified broadband Internet access service as a ""telecommunications service,"" would it be justified? ",

handful of core statutory provisions—sections 201, 202, 208, and 254—to the service.320 In addition, the 
Commission identified sections 222 and 255 as provisions that could be excluded from forbearance, 
noting that they have “attracted longstanding and broad support in the broadband context.”321 We 
received considerable comment in that proceeding and seek further and updated comment.322

should receive it in order to protect and promote Internet openness. Commenters should also detail which

rules for mobile broadband services under Title III of the Communications Act. The Supreme Court has 
found that Title III endows the Commission with “expansive powers” and a “comprehensive mandate to ‘encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.’”324 Section 303 of the Act, in 
particular, authorizes the Commission to exercise its authority as “the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity requires” to “[p]rescribe the nature of the service to be rendered by each class of licensed 
stations and each station within any class,” and to establish obligations, not inconsistent with law, as may 
be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act .325 It further directs the Commission to “generally 
encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.”326 Likewise, section 316 of 
the Act authorizes the Commission to adopt “new conditions on existing licensees” when taking such 
action will “promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity.”327 The Commission may exercise 
this authority on a license-by-license basis or through a rulemaking,328 even if the affected licenses were 
awarded at auction.329",Comment is sought on the FCC's authority to adopt oen Internet rules for mobile broadband services.,

define the scope of common carriage.332 In addition, we seek comment on the Commission’s authority to 
adopt rules under the World Trade Organization’s Basic Agreement on Trade in Telecommunications.333 
We seek comment on the efficacy of those, and other justifications for the rules we propose adopting 
here. ",What other authorities can the FCC use to adopt the adoption of its proposed rules?,
159,"III, F, 4",DISCUSSION,Legal Authority,Constitutional Considerations,,"Finally we seek comment on other legal limitations and barriers to adoption of the rules 
we propose today, including First Amendment and Due Process considerations. In the Open Internet 
Order, the Commission concluded that “broadband providers typically are best described not as 
‘speakers,’ but rather as conduits for speech,” and that the open Internet rules therefore did not implicate broadband providers’ First Amendment rights.334 The Commission also found that even if the rules “did 
implicate expressive activity, they would not violate the First Amendment”335 because they would 
advance an important government interest—“ensur[ing] the public’s access to a multiplicity of 
information sources and maximiz[ing] the Internet’s potential to further the public interest”—without 
burdening “‘substantially more speech than is necessary.’”336 We seek comment on these findings. We 
do not anticipate constitutional, statutory, or other legal barriers to adopting the rules we propose today, 
but we nonetheless seek comment on these matters. Are there modifications we could make to the 
proposals we make today that would avoid constitutional questions? ",What legal limitations are there to adopting the FCC's proposed rules?,
160,"III, G",DISCUSSION,Other Laws and Considerations,,,"The Open Internet Order provided that the open Internet rules did not alter broadband 
providers’ rights or obligations with respect to other laws or safety and security considerations.337 The 
Commission further established that the rules did not prohibit broadband providers from making 
reasonable efforts to address transfers of unlawful content and unlawful transfers of content.338 We 
tentatively conclude that this continues to be the correct approach in light of the rules proposed in today’s 
Notice. We therefore propose to retain these regulations without modification. We seek comment on this 
tentative conclusion.","The Open Internet Order does not stop broadband providers from stopping unlawful content or transfers,  the FCC believes, but it asks for comment.",
161,"III, H, 1",DISCUSSION,Enforcement and Dispute Resolution,Background,,"The Open Internet Order allowed parties to file informal complaints pursuant to section 
1.41 of the Commission’s rules and promulgated a set of formal complaint rules.339 The formal complaint 
rules give the Commission flexibility to shift the burden of proof or production where appropriate and to 
structure and streamline the process to the extent possible.340 Due to the technical nature of potential 
disputes, however, the Open Internet Order stressed the importance of direct negotiations and 
consultation with independent technical bodies in hope that parties would be able to resolve disputes 
before availing themselves of the complaint processes.341 Thus, the policy of the Commission has been to 
encourage the filing of informal, rather than formal, complaints, and thus it was not surprising that the 
Commission did not receive any formal complaints following the adoption of the Open Internet Order. 
As noted above, the Commission has received many informal complaints from consumers alleging 
violations of the Open Internet Order. In addition, the Commission takes notice of public commentary 
and events, which may lead the Enforcement Bureau to initiate its own investigation. We seek comment 
on the efficiency and functionality of the complaint processes adopted in, and used pursuant to, the Open 
Internet Order. ",The FCC has enouraged the filing of informal complaints instead of formal complaints. ,
162,"III, H, 2",DISCUSSION,Enforcement and Dispute Resolution,Designing an Effective Enforcement Process,,"The Verizon decision and our earlier data roaming rules provide a blueprint for the 
creation of a dispute resolution process to govern the rules we propose today to protect and promote the 
open Internet. Of course, there are significant potential differences between the data roaming and open 
Internet environments. For example, in Cellco, the D.C. Circuit considered a circumstance in which an 
identified party, a wireless carrier, would desire to enter into a business arrangement with another 
identified party, another wireless carrier. The rule at issue was designed to create circumstances that both 
incented individualized bargaining and, in specific circumstances, curbed the limits of such negotiation 
where necessary to serve the public interest. A similar circumstance could arise in the open Internet 
context, if for example, an app developer wished to enter into a contractual arrangement with a broadband 
provider. But it is just as possible that the entity that feels aggrieved by an alleged violation of an open 
Internet rule does not seek a direct contractual relationship with a broadband provider. That could arise, 
for example, if a website is blocked or if an edge provider feels that it is being harmed by differential 
treatment afforded by a broadband provider to its own affiliate. For this reason, the dispute resolution 
mechanism adopted by the Commission to enforce our proposed open Internet rules should be designed to 
operate between parties that do not necessarily desire to enter into a binding agreement. ",The proposed dispute resolution process should be designed to operate between parties that do not necessarilly want to entire into a binding agreement.,
163,"III, H, 2",DISCUSSION,Enforcement and Dispute Resolution,Designing an Effective Enforcement Process,,"We tentatively conclude that an effective institutional design for the rules proposed in 
today’s Notice must include at least three elements. First, there must be a mechanism to provide legal 
certainty, so that broadband providers, end users and edge providers alike can better plan their activities in 
light of clear Commission guidance. Second, there must be flexibility to consider the totality of the facts 
in an environment of dynamic innovation. Third, there must be effective access to dispute resolutions by 
end users and edge providers alike. We seek comment on these elements. Are there others that should be 
considered? Should any be eliminated? What forms of dispute resolution would be the best strategy to 
implement “data-driven decision-making”?342 ",Comment is requested on three elements proposed for the rules: a mechanism providing legal certainty; flexibility to consider the facts in a period of innovation; and effective dispute resolution.,

resolution process, whether the Commission ultimately relies on section 706, Title II, or another source of 
legal authority. We seek comment on whether and how, if at all, the source of the Commission’s legal 
authority would affect our dispute resolution and enforcement proposals.343 ",Does the FCC's legal authority affect its dispute resolution and renforcement proposals?,
165,"III, H, 2",DISCUSSION,Enforcement and Dispute Resolution,Designing an Effective Enforcement Process,Legal Certainty,"The Commission has a responsibility to provide certainty, guidance, and predictability to 
the marketplace as we protect and promote the open Internet. The most important form of guidance is, of 
course, the adoption by the Commission of a particular legal standard in the forthcoming rulemaking. As 
with the “commercially reasonable” standard employed in our data roaming rule, the purpose of such a 
legal standard is allow broadband providers, end users, and edge providers to measure broadband-
provider conduct against a known rule of law, both prospectively and retroactively. Under the existing 
rules, formal complaints would also result in Commission orders that would both decide a specific 
complaint and provide useful guidance on the application of our proposed open Internet rules—
particularly in those cases where the adjudicated set of facts is representative of a larger industry practice. 
What other forms of guidance would be helpful? For example, is there value in establishing a business-
review-letter approach similar to that of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, whereby 
entities concerned about certain practices under the new rules may ask the Commission for a statement of 
its current enforcement intentions with respect to that conduct and by which the Commission would 
publish both the request for review and its response?344 If adopted, would it make sense to have such a 
prospective review process be administered jointly by the Enforcement Bureau and the Office of General 
Counsel, or should such prospective reviews be considered by the full Commission? Should such 
guidance be binding or non-binding? How might petitions for declaratory ruling be helpful?

provide guidance before broadband providers initiate practices that are within the scope of the open 
Internet rules? For example, the Commission could designate certain staff to offer parties non-binding 
views on the likelihood that a particular practice by a broadband provider is commercially reasonable or 
commercially unreasonable (assuming that were the applicable legal standard ultimately adopted). The 
Commission has some experience with this non-binding, advisory approach to interpretation of its 
rules.345 While this type of informal guidance from staff is not binding, it may provide parties with 
helpful information as they consider whether and how to resolve a dispute privately and outside of the 
complaint process. Should we establish a similar process for helping parties anticipate issues or resolve 
disputes that might arise under our proposed open Internet rules? If so, should the non-binding guidance 
be made public in any way, or should it provide a confidential basis for early consultation? We 
emphasize that these sorts of non-binding processes would always be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the 
right of parties to seek binding determinations from the Commission through the formal or informal 
complaint process, declaratory rulings, or other mechanisms we adopt to resolve disputes and allegations 
of violations of our open Internet rules. ",Should the FCC provide guidance to broadband providers that includes non-binding staff opinions?,

advisories. For example, the Enforcement Bureau and the Office of General Counsel issued an 
enforcement advisory in 2011, providing additional insight into the application of the transparency rule.346

application come to, or are brought to, their attention? Should such enforcement advisories be considered

today must be flexible enough to account for the totality of circumstances, including Internet evolution 
and innovation from all sources over time. In the Open Internet Order, the Commission stated that it 
would make certain determinations on a case-by-case basis.347 The Commission also stated in the Data 
Roaming Order that it would determine whether the terms and conditions of a proffered data roaming 
arrangement were commercially reasonable on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the totality 
of the circumstances.348 Based on the Commission’s precedent in using this decision-making process, we 
tentatively conclude that we will adopt a similar case-by-case analysis and consider the totality of the 
circumstances to consider alleged violations of our proposed open Internet rules. Such an approach 
would, for example, allow the Commission to consider any sources of innovation when analyzing 
whether conduct meets the legal standard ultimately adopted by the Commission. Moreover, this 
approach helps to ensure that, as new circumstances exist, the Commission and interested parties will be 
advantaged by a culture of learning that, drawing on the strengths of common-law reasoning, reflects the 
experiences of the present, as well as the logic of the past.349 We seek comment on whether the combination of a certain legal standard and a case-by-case approach provides the best means of both 
providing guidance and cabining administrative discretion, while ensuring that a system of dispute

burden of production shift from the party bringing the claim to the other party in a dispute? Should

170,"III, H, 2",DISCUSSION,Enforcement and Dispute Resolution,Designing an Effective Enforcement Process,Effective Access to Dispute Resolution,"To be effective in protecting and promoting Internet openness, the process for enforcing 
the rules we propose today must be accessible to a diverse array of affected parties. As noted above, the 
Open Internet Order contemplated informal and formal complaints but did not include any alternative 
mechanisms for either providing guidance beforehand or resolution in the wake of a challenge to an 
existing practice. But, as also noted above, the rules proposed in today’s Notice will operate in an 
environment in which a complaining party may not have sought, or may not even want, to enter into a 
contractual arrangement with a broadband provider. Moreover, the ability of edge providers to effectively 
access a dispute resolution is important to the administrative effectiveness of any legal regime that the 
Commission might adopt. To what extent should the structure of edge provider market segments impact 
the kind of regime that the Commission adopts? For example, although 17 broadband access providers 
accounted for about 93 percent of U.S. retail subscribers in 2013,350 near the end of that year there were 
almost 900 app developers that each served more than one million active users globally.351 And app 
developers as a group may be quite a bit smaller than broadband providers; one estimate in 2013 
calculated that 65 percent of app developers garner less than $35,000 per year.352 Moreover, individuals

any legal considerations, limitations, or concerns that the Commission should consider with adopting an

that under our informal dispute resolution procedures, Commission staff can mediate disputes if parties 
voluntarily request such a process. During such mediations, for instance, the staff may ask parties to 
submit their best offers to facilitate negotiations. We also can adopt specific rules to determine
